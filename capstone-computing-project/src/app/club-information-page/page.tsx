                            Founded over three decades ago, the Alabama Water Ski Team started as a small group of dedicated skiers. Over the years, weâ€™ve grown into a nationally ranked powerhouse, competing at the highest level in collegiate water skiing. Our rich history is marked by continuous improvement, hard work, and the pursuit of excellence, making us one of the most respected teams in the NCWSA.

                            We focus on three primary events in competitive water skiing: Slalom, Trick, and Jump. Each of our athletes specializes in one or more of these events, training rigorously to compete at the highest level. Whether it's carving through a slalom course, performing complex trick routines, or flying off the jump ramp, our skiers are committed to pushing their limits and striving for personal bests.
