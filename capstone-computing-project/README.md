steps to get started:

make sure your directory is in capstone-computing-project folder with 
cd UA-Waterski-Senior-Design
cd capstone-computing-project


In your terminal, make sure to type "npm i" which installs necessary dependencies onto your computer
then type "npm run dev" to run the localhost. This localhost will automatically update as you type your code. 


also unfortunately single apostrophes in typed text won't work with how we deployed the website (like the word I'm) BUT we can type &apos; to make I&apos;m     and that would work



for login / signup:
need two terminals. one will type 'npm run dev' and the other terminal will be for 'node index.js'

node index.js will connect to the amazon aws database
